===================

Notice a theme going on? I wrote YET ANOTHER OC TRANSPO application but this time for the Android platform. It can tell you where your bus is, its speed, and when its arrival time is. Very experimental as it was just a proof of concept that I didn't forget how to write Android code. It requires the web back end I wrote in order to work as OC Transpo doesn't serve data in JSON format which is a requirement for the Android app.
